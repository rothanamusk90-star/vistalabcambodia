# VistaLab Cambodia Website

## Open and run the website

1. Open a terminal in this project folder.
2. Install dependencies if this is the first run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the local URL printed in the terminal. It is usually <http://localhost:5173>.
5. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Build and preview

- Check TypeScript and create a production build:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  The production files are created in the `dist/` folder.

- Preview the production build on your computer:

  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

  Open the local URL printed in the terminal.

The demo CMS stores edits in the current browser's local storage. Changes do not automatically sync to other browsers or devices.

## Configure admin sign-in

The admin page is hidden from the public navigation. Open it directly at `https://rothanamusk90-star.github.io/vistalabcambodia/?admin=1` after completing these steps:

1. Create a Supabase project and add an email/password user in **Authentication → Users**.
2. Run [`supabase/admin_auth_setup.sql`](supabase/admin_auth_setup.sql) in the Supabase SQL Editor, then uncomment its final insert and replace `YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL` with that user's email. Run the insert to grant admin access.
3. In GitHub, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** and add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` using the Supabase project URL and publishable/anon key. Never use the service role key in the website.
4. Redeploy the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow. The login screen will be enabled after deployment.

The CMS currently stores its edits only in the signed-in browser. Supabase protects access to the admin screen; it does not yet sync CMS content between visitors or devices.
